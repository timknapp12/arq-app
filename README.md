# ARQ - React Native

## Context
I wrote 99% of the code in this repo while I worked at Q Sciences from 2021-2023. It became an app in Apple App Store and Google Play known as ARQ. There were tens of thousands of downloads and supported in several countries and languages.

## Description
This project is for the frontend of Q Connect Pro mobile app for Q Sciences. It is built in React Native.
The app is a tool to help corporate leaders and distributors build and manage their business.

## Resources for Getting Started
This project is built with a tool called Expo. Expo is a framework to help with the development process of apps made with react native.
The docs can be found [here](https://docs.expo.io).
Expo allows for testing to be done on device simulators for both Android and iOS and also on actual devices.

1. To run on an actual device, download the expo app from app store or Google Play. Then, in the project run `expo start`, which will open a page in a web browser. This page will have a QR Code. Scan the code with your phone's camera and it will open the project in the app.
2. To run on an Android emulator, check out the expo docs [here](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
3. To run on an iOS simulator, check out the expo docs [here](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/ios-simulator/)
